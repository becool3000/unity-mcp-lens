# Changelog

All notable Unity MCP Lens package changes are documented here.

## [2.3.0-pre.2] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- Split Unity MCP Lens into the standalone package id `com.becool3000.unity-mcp-lens`.
- Renamed owned assemblies and namespaces to `Becool.UnityMcpLens.*`.
- Moved active package code to `Editor/Lens` and `Runtime`.
- Removed copied Assistant UI/runtime/cloud/generator/search/sample folders from the standalone package.
- Removed the bundled legacy relay binaries from Lens; Lens now installs only the owned `unity-mcp-lens` server.
- Added migration guidance and package identity static checks.

### Preserved

- Standard MCP server identity `unity-mcp-lens`.
- Tool names, tool packs, detail refs, schema caching, and compact health surface.
- Editor access under `Tools > Unity MCP Lens` and `Project Settings > Tools > Unity MCP Lens`.
